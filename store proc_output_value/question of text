The database also contains a list of scheduled courses called tblSchedule, showing for each course which resources it uses:

SQL exercise - Parameters and return values (image 2)
The first course, for example, uses resources 574 and 595 - ie SPECIAL EQUIPMENT and a FLIP CHART

Write a stored procedure which:

Takes in the name of a resource as a parameter
Works out the id of this resource (or returns prematurely if the resource name doesn't exist in the tblResource table)
Works out how many courses use this resource (see hint below), and returns this number
You can use either an output parameter or a return value to return the number (the example below uses both, which is definitely overkill):

SQL exercise - Parameters and return values (image 3)
This is what calling your stored procedure could look like

To work out which courses use a resource, add a comma before and after both the ResourceIds column value and the resource id that you're looking for - then it won't matter whether the resource that you're searching for is the first, last or only one in its list.
